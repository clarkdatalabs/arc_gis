ESRI, the makers of ArcGIS for Desktop, ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Online, as well as other products, have a tremendous amount of learning material available to support the use of their tools.

This workshop provides a step-by-step tutorial for getting started with ArcGIS Desktop, a slideshow presentation, and example data ([available in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/clarkdatalabs/arc_gis))
